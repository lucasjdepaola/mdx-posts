# Recursive Window Manager in react

When developing a browser OS, creating a tiling window manager would be entirely unique to the web, and there is not currently one out there.
Seeing traditional tiling window managers, there are typically a few steps in order to implement one correctly.

- A meta key (control/ctrl is the meta key for this OS)
- 10 workspaces (ctrl-[0-9])
- Moveable windows (ctrl-shift-[0-9], ctrl-shift-[hjkl])
- Windows that auto size, and tile in a visually pleasing manner

Meta key, workspaces, and moveable windows were fairly trivial. Simply use a state for the current workspace (one that is reactive),
while keeping an array of 1-10 passive workspaces that aren't in use (write through the reactive one). The hard part is tiling the windows.
The easiest first step is to try and see if the problem already has been worked on for some pointers (it has not on the web). One might
think to do this entirely manual, keeping account for the exact fixed width, height, top, left, for the current app. This would require
a lot of edge cases, manual dom manipulation (if using states this would be equally hard), and at the end of the day, not a very dynamic
solution when wanting to branch off of this and use different tiling solutions. For this to be a success, it cannot be hard coded, it cannot
be fixed in length (infinite apps should be capable per window, do not solve for 1,2,3, ... n), and it needs to be relatively flat, meaning not
to manually create new divs to contain the windows.

Let's lay out more explicitly what this window manager does to a window, given cases 1-4, which can infer n.

- Base case: No windows open, don't do anything.
- One window: App window is full size of the screen (while still showing the top bar)
- Two windows: ^^ Window above pushes left, 1/2 width. Second window is equally 1/2 width on the right side of the screen
- Three windows: Window1 stays the same (from here on out), window2 now shrinks half in height, pushing to the top, with the third window filling this gap
- Four windows: Window3 shrinks half in width, Window4 fills this gap, (same pattern to infinity)

Now that we know the intended goal (albeit complex when thinking stylistically rather than programatically), implementing this becomes much
more tricky when finding a truly elegant solution.

I started by trying to use flexbox, which simply sandwhiched every div row or height wise, with zero alternation (fail 1). Obviously one
style trait could not solve this issue. But we now know that flexbox is the elegant way of solving this, so solving it in a flex manner
is now firm. Diving into advanced css techniques, nth-child seemed promising. What if we used a flex-direction switch for every odd nth child?
The problem here lies within the hierarchy, every odd div does in fact need a flex-direction change, however, every app container has no subdivs
and the parent container contains all sub divs, meaning that changing flex-direction cannot do anything, as it can only mutate it's own subdivs,
which are none. This is slowly making the answer more apparent.

This solution does not exist anywhere, to save any future tediousness, I asked gpt-4o this question, to which it had the same tone
as I, the problem was very clear, yet an elegant solution is simply not possible. It recommended I hard-code nth-child (1, 2, ... 6)
styles, making the divs progressively smaller, to which this did not work either. The conversations were more iterative rather than asking
a magic genie for the answer, which it did not have any for me sadly. I decided to take a break.

## The answer
Sometimes sitting around and doing nothing makes the answer so trivial, what if jsx had recursive components which could handle potential
html depth of hierarchy, rather than keeping it flat (the answer is no longer feasible when flat). It turns out that jsx in fact allows recursion.
So what would the structure look like? Imagine it like this pseudo code.
```jsx
component Recurse(app)
  <div name="recursiveparent">
    <div name="self">{app}</div>
    if app.hasNext()
      then <Recurse app={app.nextapp()} />
    /* if there's another app, render it recursively */
  </div>
```

This recursive structure takes what should be hundreds of lines of (bug prone) code, into a few powerful lines of code.
All we need now is an understanding of the condition for hasNext().
Simple, if the element index is not greater than the list length.

A few small tweaks such as putting the component into the scope of the array, and giving the component an index property instead,
the solution is as follows
```jsx
        return app && ( // app exists, and component
            <div
            className="flex w-full h-full" // take up full width and height
            style={{ flexDirection: p.index % 2 === 1 ? "column" : "row", }}> // alternate between row and col direction
                <div className="flex-1"> // grow as much as possible
                    <AppWrapper {...props}>
                        <app.component {...props} />
                    </AppWrapper>
                </div>
                {p.index < props.openedApps.length - 1 && (
                // condition in order to recurse^^
                    <div className="flex-1">
                        <RecursiveTileApps index={p.index + 1} /> // recurse
                    </div>
                )}
            </div>
        )
```

I trimmed this code down a bit (compared to the production answer), and looks slightly complicated, but this solution is extremely
elegant and has no edge cases, which was well worth the effort.
