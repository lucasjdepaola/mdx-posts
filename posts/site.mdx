# Information about the site

This website is in progress currently, and this article can describe the process of making this site.
I'm currently in between trying to make the pseudo OS, and the post site itself. Setting up remote MDX via a git repository
was a huge pain, but after setting it up, it seems like it's smooth sailing from here.

## Intuition behind the posts page

I was stuck between the choice of keeping my markdown posts inside of my own project directory, but I realized how quickly this
became illogical. Imagine if you owned facebook, and every time someone made a post, you'd have to rebuild the site. I realized
this was the logic when keeping posts inside of the site repo. When separating this from the main repo, it frees you from having
to keep everything in one directory and rebuild an entire project upon every upload. Making this took a lot of work, and is still in progress,
however, the decision to do it the right way instead of the fast way will pay off in the end.

## How do you know what posts will be available if the repo is detached, along with sorting it date-wise?

A content management system would typically handle this for you if you were to use one. Using MDX-remote is enough dependency for
my liking, so I figured I would make a script post-side, that will generate a json file containing the proper static metadata.
Think about it, if you need to commit this to a git repo, building a chain of commands can seamlessly upload the proper config.
```bash
upload() {
  tsx parseMetaData.ts
  git commit -am "new post"
  git push -u origin main
}
upload
```
parse metadata should recursively go through the directories, parse front matter, then place it in a json file. Let's do this manually.

```json
{
  posts: [
    {
      name: "site.mdx"
      metadata: {
        title: "Site notes"
        description: "Information about developing the site"
        date: "9-11-2024"
        slug: "site-noting"
      }
    },
    {
      name: first.mdx
      ... etc
    }
  ]
}
```
This could be even more modular if were made as a cli tool, but assuming typescript is downloaded for my own personal use is fair enough.

Having this data now allows for the [posts](/posts) to have all the information required to route to the mdx posts without knowing of the routes

This specific solution solves a problem of wanting a personally integrated CMS (blog, news, etc) in your website, without needing static
rebuilds, a hefty CMS (just git push), or content in any specific directory. This is all tailored to where someone wants to write.

## How can you make this less technical?

To make this even more tailored and less technical, you can create a personal obsidian vault dedicated to this repo, so that editing markdown is wysiwyg.
The only issue is double bracket linking. Typically in obsidian, you get a nice auto completion when typing a \[\]link\]\] as shown.
The problem is that this only works in obsidian, and this is not real markdown. This instead translates to \[link\]\(link.md\) which may be
tedious to type. The obsidian editor has a plugin that covers this, so there's zero overhead.
