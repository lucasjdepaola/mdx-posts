# Problem

When setting up (coincidentally) this website, I realized that I needed to use a database "Group by" query for my array of objects,
I wanted to group the FilePosts by the route which is a sub property of a FilePost. I looked for this online to see if a native method existed,
which I could not find, except for someone asking the same question, in which the solution involved a lot of complex mutations. I figured,
since I'm on the subject, why not try to do this entirely functionally with no mutations, has this been done? While I'm at it, I might as well
make it a one-liner.

```js
    export const groupBy = (arr: any[], key: string) =>  // Lucas DePaola
        arr.reduce((pv, cv) => ({...pv, [cv[key]]: [...pv[cv[key]]||[], cv] || []}), {});
```

## Intuition behind this counterintuitive method

- Create a lambda such that there is an array and a key that needs grouped by such key.
- Reduce this array (iterate with an accum val), and change the reduction to an object
- return the new object such that you spread the previous values (accumulate previous object), then use the value of the key as a key itself
- Spread the value of the previous object which accesses the value of the same key as the original key (best way I can explain it)
- If this value simply does not exist yet, create an empty array
- If the key of the current value doesn't exist, create an empty array

Here's an example using my specific case I needed this for

This post is under the [posts](/posts) route, so the order would be
```js
{
  posts: [
    {
      // this post as an object (containing everything you might imagine)
    }
  ],
  news: [] // nothing yet (but it's important this value exists)

}
```

In order to cache the metadata of my total posts locally, I created a script to traverse all of the mdx and md files recursively,
except, the object looked like this:
```js
{
  name: thispost.mdx,
  route: posts // it's a sub trait, not a parent
  metadata: ...etc
}
```

Since I need to order all posts by it's route, I needed the groupBy function, thus leading me to the infamous functional one-liner
